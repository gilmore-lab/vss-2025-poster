# Motivation {-}

Replication is a cornerstone of scientific rigor and a prerequisite for cumulative science.
Direct replication is common in some subfields and topics, but less so in others.
This project synthesized evidence from published research across a four decade period that employed a widely used measure of grating visual acuity (VA), Teller [@Teller1986-oc] Acuity Cards (TAC). 
We sought to capture findings about the development of VA in early childhood, harmonize them into an aggregated dataset, and share the dataset openly.
The ultimate goal is to characterize how grating visual acuity develops.

# Methods {-}

To achieve this, we did the following:

1. Searched Google Scholar for the terms “teller acuity cards”, “visual acuity cards”, or “teller cards".
2. Determined which papers had full-text or PDFs available.
3. Evaluated each paper to determine whether it had extractable data or contained summaries of data presented elsewhere.
4. Harmonized the data into a soon-to-be-shared Google sheet.
5. Created visualizations and summaries of the data.

# Results: Sources synthesized {-}

- *n*=751 found
- *n*=432 had PDFs or full-text versions available
- *n*=28 had extractable data in a form suitable for synthesis (acuity values, age, sample size)
- Synthesis is ongoing

# Results: Typically developing children {-}

Across the *n*=20 papers, *n*=5,700 participant observations are included. The *n*`s per age group are in [1, 84] with a median of *n*=20.

# Conclusions {-}

::: {.block fill="luma(210)" inset="10pt" radius="15pt" stroke="5pt + blue"}

- Synthesizing evidence about core facets of human visual development is important and illuminating.
- Variation in mean acuity thresholds at different ages and by card type pose challenges for norm-setting [e.g., @Neijzen2025-ak].
- Idiosyncratic practices for reporting data in published papers make evidence synthesis challenging, even when researchers use a common method.
- Vision scientists should adopt open data sharing practices more widely and should curate shared data in ways that make synthesis, aggregation, and reuse easier.
