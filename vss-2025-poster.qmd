# Motivation {-}

Replication is a cornerstone of scientific rigor and a prerequisite for cumulative science.
Direct replication is common in some subfields and topics, but less so in others.
This project synthesized evidence from published research across a four decade period that employed a widely used measure of grating visual acuity (VA), Teller [@Teller1986-oc] Acuity Cards (TAC). 
We sought to capture findings about the development of VA in early childhood, harmonize them into an aggregated dataset, and share the dataset openly.
The ultimate goal was to characterize how grating visual acuity develops.

# Methods {-}

To achive this, we did the following:

1. Searched Google Scholar for the terms “teller acuity cards”, “visual acuity cards”, or “teller cards" and found *n*=751 papers.
2. Determined which papers had full-text or PDFs available (*n*=433).
3. Evaluated each paper to determine which had extractable data or had summaries of data presented elsewhere (*n*=27).
4. Harmonized the data into a soon-to-be-shared Google sheet.
5. Created visualizations and summaries of the data.

# Conclusions {-}

::: {.block fill="luma(210)" inset="5pt" radius="15pt" stroke="5pt + blue"}

- Synthesizing evidence about core facets of human visual development is important and illuminating.

- Variation in mean acuity thresholds at different ages and by card type pose challenges for norm or standard-setting.

- Idiosyncratic practices for reporting data in published papers make evidence synthesis challenging, even when researchers use a common method.

- Future work will involve: 1. Acquiring papers that did not have full text versions available and incorporating their findings, and 2. Contacting individual researchers to seek unpublished datasets.

- Vision scientists should adopt open data sharing practices more widely and should curate shared data in ways that make synthesis and aggregation easier.
